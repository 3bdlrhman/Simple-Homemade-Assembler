# Simple-Homemade-Assembler
This is an Assembler that converts mnemonics written in  Hack Assembly language to Hack machine code

Project 6 of the Nand2Tetris course is about building an assembler, a program that translates assembly language code into machine language code. The project involves designing and implementing a two-pass assembler that can process assembly language code and generate corresponding binary machine language code. 

In the first pass, the assembler reads the entire assembly language code and builds a symbol table that maps labels to memory addresses. In the second pass, the assembler reads the assembly code again, translates each instruction into binary code, and substitutes any labels with their corresponding memory addresses from the symbol table.

The assembler is expected to handle all the standard assembly language instructions, including arithmetic and logical operations, memory access instructions, branching and conditional instructions, and input/output instructions. It should also be able to handle labels, variables, and constants defined in the assembly code.

The project is a significant challenge and requires a good understanding of computer architecture, assembly language, and programming principles. Successful completion of the project will provide a deeper understanding of how high-level programming languages are translated into machine language code that can be executed by a computer's CPU.
